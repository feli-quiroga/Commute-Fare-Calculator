As a Toronto Metropolitan University student that commutes to and from the university every day, the amount of money I spend on transportation each month
is a really important factor that I have to account for when budgeting for university. Calculating exactly how much money I will be spending a month on
transportation is surprisingly difficult as the way Go transit calculates your fare depends on several factors, so in order to make it easier for other
students like myself, I wrote this program.

This program calculates exactly how much money you will be spending on transportation when using the Go Train system on all lines, it also accounts if you use local
transit to get to and from your Go Train Station as well as if you take the TTC subway to get from Union Station to campus and back.
